# Skycat's Binary Search Tool
This tool helps you binary search through your fabric mod list. This is useful when you think there is one mod that is causing problems, but you can't figure out which one from logs. This will NOT work when there's more than one mod causing the problem, when you're missing dependencies (including Minecraft or Java), or for non-fabric things.
